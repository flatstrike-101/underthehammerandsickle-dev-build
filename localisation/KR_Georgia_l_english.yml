POLITICS_IOSEB_JUGHASHVILI_DESC:0 "Ioseb Besarionis dzе Jughashvili was born on December 18, 1878, in Gori, Georgia.  In 1899, Ioseb began work as a meteorologist at Tiflis Observatory, where he attracted a group of supporters because of his classes in socialist theory. With the support of his followers, he organized a secret workers’ mass-meeting for May 1, 1900; this meeting encouraged many people to strike. By then, however, the Okhrana found out about Ioseb’s activities within Tiflis' revolutionary milieu. They tried to arrest him in 1901, but Ioseb went into hiding. In January 1905, some government soldiers killed protesters in Saint Petersburg, causing unrest throughout the Russian Empire, which was known as the Revolution of 1905.The revolution ended two years later with the revolutionaries’ victory, resulting in the October Manifesto and establishment of the State Duma. In 1908, Ioseb was arrested, and interned in the Bailov Prison in Baku. Later on in 1909 he was sentenced to two years exile in Solvychegodsk. In June 1909, he escaped to Saint Petersburg. Then in 1910, he was arrested again and was sent back to Solvychegodsk. In June 1911, Stalin was allowed to move to Vologda. Again he escaped back to Saint Petersburg, and was arrested in 1911 and sentenced to three more years of exile in Vologda. In January 1912, Vladimir Lenin and Grigory Zinoviev decided to co-opt Ioseb into the First Central Committee. While still being in exile in Vologda he agreed to remain a Central Committee member for the rest of his life. Ioseb then again in 1912 escaped to Saint Petersburg, he was arrested and sent to Siberia. In 1916 while Ioseb was in exile, Russia entered the Great War. Ioseb was in the city when the February Revolution happened, uprisings happened in Petrograd or formerly known as Saint Petersburg, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated to escape being overthrown violently, Russia became led by a Provisional Government, this Provisional Government was mostly liberals. But in 1918 after Lenin was assassinated and Bukharin and Kamenev took power of the Bolshevik party, Ioseb doubted the party would ever rule Russia, so he fled to Tbilisi, Georgia. By 1920 the Russian Civil War ended after the Social Revolutionaries and Bolsheviks decided to have a stalemate. By 1926, Ioseb had developed his own ideas sort of like Totalism, he thought of an ideology which he called National-Communism, this ideology was based on authoritarianism and Bolshevism. Then in 1928 he decided to write a manifesto on his National-Communism ideology, later that year he founded the Sakartvelos Erovnul-K’omunist’uri P’art’ia. His party quickly grew and 1930 his party was one of the biggest parties in Georgia. In 1931 Ioseb felt like it was time to strike, so he did and the Georgian Revolution had begun, there were three sides, the National-Communists, the Social-Democrats, and the Monarchists/Paternal Autocrats. In 1933 the last battle was fought between Ioseb’s forces and Zhordania’s forces, it was an easy victory for Ioseb, the peace treaty was signed on July 7, 1933. A new Georgia was formed the Georgian Socialist Workers’ Republic. Then in 1934 when the Azerbaijani-Armenia war started Ioseb requested Armenia to become a puppet state of Georgia or there would be a two front war for Armenia, so they accepted Ioseb quickly put his right-hand man, Sergo Ordzhonikidze in charge of Armenia, Armenia and Azerbaijan peaced out three months after Sergo took power, but this wasn't for long until 1934 when extreme-rightists took power in Azerbaijan, Armenia used the excuse and said they felt threatened so they invaded Orumiyeh with the help of Georgia and they easily won and took only the province Orumiyeh. Armenia decide to make Orumiyeh a puppet state of Georgia, Armenia also put a group of Armenian generals in charge of Orumiyeh and formed the, Armenian Military Council of Orumiyeh. Now that Ioseb had gained some power, the people3 of Georgia felt like Ioseb really was the right path for Georgia.. Will Ioseb make Georgia a great nation? Will Ioseb take back old Georgian Territories?"

### Ideas ###
GEO_stalins_georgia_idea:0 "Ioseb's Totalist Dictatorship"
GEO_stalins_georgia_idea_desc:0 "After two years of war, Ioseb Jughashvili's forces came out on top, destoying the monarchists and social-democrats. After Ioseb's forces won the war Ioseb set up a totalist dicatatorship in Georgia forming the Georgian Socialist Workers' Republic, this new state would become a violent dictatorship. Ioseb despised all other parties, he hated anyone who spoke out against him, those people were most likley never seen again. Ioseb would have people who spoke out agianst him arrested, beaten by police, or even killed. It's to the point were people are even scared to talk out againts Ioseb to their family. But people still support Ioseb, because of his goals to restore Georgian borders and to improve the Georgian industry, technology, and military. Ioseb supports his people and wants to do the best for them, while still having extremist radical beleifs."

GEO_crippled_georgia_idea_desc:0 "After the Georgian Civil War it left many people starving and living on the streets. The aftermath of the civil war left the industry weak, the military is useless, many people dont have jobs, many kids are left without parents, and good education. Ioseb has a project he wants to conduct which he calls, P’roekt’i Aghvadginot Sakartvelo, in Enlgish means Project Rebuild Georgia, this project will basically offer more jobs that doesn't need a good education, such as working in factories, Ioseb will also build 100s of farms for the Georgian people for free. This project will also fund the education of the Georgian youth, the project will also fund the military and trade with other allies for better equipment. But will this project really happen? Will it go well?"

GEO_georgian_pride_idea_desc:0 "Although Georgia just came out of a brutal two year war, and is suffering severly economically and military-wise, the people still have hope in their new government. The people of Georgia are helping in many ways, although they are starving and living on the streets with little money. Day by day many Georgians join the military to support the Georgian army. The people beleive Ioseb can rebuild Georgia's economy, and help people get new and better jobs. The people of Georgia have come together to help each other go through these hard times."
